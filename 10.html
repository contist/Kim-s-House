  <br><br>Thank you for noticing our mistake.
  I removed one of the Figures and updated the report accordingly.
  Please find the updated version attached.</p>
  <p style="margin-top:40px;">Please notice that I did not make a new revision so please delete the old revision D.</p>
  <br><br>  I’d appreciate your effort to meet our request for the result of Acoustic modeling for Samcheok project.
  Speaking of this project, we will do our best to achieve it in next year again.
  <p>To finalize this, here one more question ;</p>

  <<img src="coding.jpg" width="80%">
  1.	Figure A3 and A5 : For me, they are the same graphs. Do you have any reason why it’s included again ?
  Or, do you want to put the graph for 22Hz ?
  Once this project is actually started and our engineers need more information about installation,
  I will discuss with you further. In the meantime, there is no more questions about the acoustic modeling.
